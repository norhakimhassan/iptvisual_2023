#Aims and objectives:
To understand the effects of different coil geometries and misalignments, both linear and angular, on the performance of the WPTS.
The overall purpose is to systematically analyse coil geometries and misalignments to inform the selection of the number of spokes to be used in a collapsible system.

#Expected analysis from the generated data:
To find the feasible coil shape based on the dataset and identify the compensable parameter as the WPT system trade-off to be implemented in the later stage.  
To understand the effect of linear and angular misalignments on the coil coupling coefficient and mutual inductance.
Power electronics point of view: system impedance, coupling coefficient, mutual inductance, system efficiency.
Robotic point of view: sufficient transmitted power (100 W for a mid-sized inspection robot, output voltage, and system stability to charge the onboard batteries of the mobile robot, the feasibility of mechanical design in comparison with the mobile robot’s dimension and payload. – these limitations challenge the design criteria & parameter selections as trade-offs from the power electronics perspective. 


#Parameters and operational envelope:
The geometry of the coil is a function of the number of spokes, n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 32, which determines the coupling coefficient for each of the data sets.
The number of turns is fixed to 5, with the same wire cross-sectional radius of 5 mm, and an aperture/diameter of 1-m. 
The operational envelope is set with a linear operational range in the x-, y- and z-axes of ± 25 cm (resolution of 1 cm) relative to the centre of the receiver coil,  
and an angular operational range of 90° (resolution of 1°) around each of the three axes.
